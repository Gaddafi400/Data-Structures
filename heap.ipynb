    "Because we make use of a binary tree, the bottom of the heap contains the maximum number of nodes. As we go up a level, the number of nodes decreases by half. Considering there are 'n' number of nodes, then the number of nodes starting from the bottom-most level would be-\n",

    "`Complexity of inserting a new node`\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, when we insert a new value in the heap when making the heap, the max number of steps we would need to take comes out to be O(log(n)). As we use binary trees, we know that the max height of such a structure is always O(log(n)). When we insert a new value in the heap, we will swap it with a value greater than it, to maintain the max-heap property. The number of such swaps would be O(log(n)). Therefore, the insertion of a new value when building a max-heap would be O(log(n)).\n",
    "\n",
    "`Complexity of removing the max valued node from heap`\n",
    "\n",
    "Likewise, when we remove the max valued node from the heap, to add to the end of the list, the max number of steps required would also be O(log(n)). Since we swap the max valued node till it comes down to the bottom-most level, the max number of steps we'd need to take is the same as when inserting a new node, which is O(log(n)).\n",

    "The time complexity of converting a list into a heap using the create_heap function is not O(log(n)). This is because when we create a heap, not all nodes will move down O(log(n)) times. It's only the root node that'll do so. The nodes at the bottom-most level (given by n/2) won't move down at all. The nodes at the second last level (n/4) would move down 1 time, as there is only one level below remaining to move down. The nodes at the third last level would move down 2 times, and so on. So if we multiply the number of moves we take for all nodes, mathematically, it would turn out like a geometric series, as explained below-\n",

    "\n",
    "`Total time complexity`\n",
    "\n",
    "In the final function of heapsort, we make use of create_heap, which runs once to create a heap and has a runtime of O(n). Then using a for-loop, we call the max_heapify for each node, to maintain the max-heap property whenever we remove or insert a node in the heap. Since there are 'n' number of nodes, therefore, the total runtime of the algorithm turns out to be O(n(log(n)), and we use the max-heapify function for each node.\n",

    "`Space Complexity of Heap Sort`\n",
    "Since heapsort is an in-place designed sorting algorithm, the space requirement is constant and therefore, O(1). This is because, in case of any input- We arrange all the list items in place using a heap structure We put the removed item at the end of the same list after removing the max node from the max-heap. Therefore, we don't use any extra space when implementing this algorithm. This gives the algorithm a space complexity of O(1)."
